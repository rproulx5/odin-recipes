    <p>This is a recipe to make the most delicious brownies known to humans. We hope you enjoy this recipe.</p>

    <p2>A simple recipe handed down from generations, it only requires basic ingredients, please see below.</p2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>10 tablepoons of butter</li>
    <li>1 1/4 cup of white granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3/4 cup and 2 tablespoons of unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
    <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
    <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
    <li>1/2 cup of all purpose flour </li>
    <li>2/3 cups of chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
    <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.</li>
    <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering. See the notes section below for tips on making these without a double-boiler and instead using a microwave or making them directly in a saucepan.</li>
    <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
    <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
    <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
    <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
    <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes (see video for reference).</li>
    <li>Stir in nuts if using.</li>
    <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>
    <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
    <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan — this step is essential and helps the brownies set. Cut into 16 squares.</li>
